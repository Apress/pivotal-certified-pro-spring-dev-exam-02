== Building and Deploying
This project has been configured to use gradle wrapper considering any future updates.
All the gradle commands mentioned, can be executed using gradle wrapper.

For example - build can be done as `./gradlew build`

This is a Gradle multi-module project. The *-practice projects, have tests and pieces left unimplemented so building the full project using:
----
gradle build
----
will fail.

To build the full project and skipping tests, build from the root (`pivotal-certified-pro-spring-dev-exam-02`) directory:
----
gradle build -x test
----

To use cached builds execute:
----
gradle --build-cache clean build assemble
----

To build the project  and scan your build execute:
----
gradle clean build --scan
----
Just keep in mind, the project is quite big and when displaying the results, you browser might be slow.
